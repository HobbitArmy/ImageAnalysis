If nothing else, I have lots of awesome and amazing ideas to try.  The day
I run out of new ideas for longer than 5 minutes is the day I need to retire
and give up all this insanity for good.

This directory is a sandbox for developing and testing new ideas.  For older
ideas that I've moved past, check out the archive directory.  Some of those
ideas were really good, or I worked out how to do some tricky stuff ... but
then found a better way, or made a change that side stepped the need in the
first place.
