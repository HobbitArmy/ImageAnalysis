# Install Python3 (Anaconda Python 3.x version)

  Download & install: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

  I recomment not changing any of the install defaults (unless you are
  are familiar with python setup choices and have a specific reason to
  do something different.)

# Download Image Analysis tools

  browser -> https://github.com/UASLab/ImageAnalysis/
  Code -> download zip (ImageAnalysis-master.zip)
  Extract All -> to Desktop (or your preferred location)
  
# Setup the Anaconda3 environment

  Start Menu -> Anaconda3 -> Anaconda Prompt:

  > cd to the ImageAnalysis install location (from previous step).
    Make sure you are inside the top ImageAnalysis-master directory.
  > There should be an "environment.yml" file here.
  > Run: "conda env create -f environment.yml"
    This will install all the libraries and prerequisites to run the
    image analysis tools.

# Activate the environment

  Do this each time you start an anaconda prompt to run the
  ImageAnalysis tools.

  (From an anaconda3 prompt)

  Run: "conda activate ImageAnalysis"

# Run the explorer.py tool

  (From an anaconda3 prompt)

  > cd to the ImageAnalysis install location (from previous step).
    Make sure you are inside the top ImageAnalysis-master directory.

  > cd to the scripts subdirectory one level below the main install
    directory.

  > run: "python explorer.py"

    After a few moments, a folder selector box will open up and you
    can select the folder containing the data set you wish to explore.
